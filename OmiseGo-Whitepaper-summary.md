## Abstract

OmiseGO is building a decentralized exchange, liquidity provider mechanism, clearing house messaging network, and asset-backed blockchain gateway. ***OmiseGo is an open distributed network of vaildators which enforce behavior of all participants*** . It uses the mechanism of a protocol token to create a proof-of-stake blockchain to enable enforcement of market activity amongst participants.

## 1. Introduction adn Problem Statement ##

The primary role of blockchains are solve coordination problems among multilateral agreements between a network of participants.

Any single participant is more willing to use systems where the business processes and mechanisms itself are not owned by any other single participants. There is a fundamental coordination problem amongst payment processor, gateways, and financial institutions. These are usually constructed by creating a clearinghouse which manages the interchange, usually via a messaging  network with either a central counter-party clearinghouse or nostro/vostro account.

These  centralized  networks  allow  for  the  controlling  entity  to arbitrarily change the mechanisms, which result in significant amount of transaction costs via information costs, due diligence, and contractual enforcement between all parties.

***We believe that there is currently a large emerging market of disruption in digital payments with new payment platforms (e.g.  Venmo, Alipay, etc.). ***

Blockchains allows society to externalize the worldâ€™s business processes from single centralized corporations into open, decentralized computing networks. OmiseGO (OMG)is a network which decentralizes market liquidity, order book matching and execution, clearinghouse custodianship, and high-scalability payments to ***help resolve payments across these emerging eWallet payment networks.***
